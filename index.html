            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is Caelin Hargrave. I'm 29 and coming to you from sweaty Houston, Texas.<br>
            I recently finished a 8yr commitment to the Navy where I served as an aviation electronics technician.<br>
            Before joining the military I attended Texas Tech university to get a bachelor's degree in computer science.<br>
            After a few years I decided to join the military for a break and to get my college paid for. Now I'm just<br>
            trying to reach that same end goal on a way shorter time frame. I'm hoping to get a dev job in the Web 3 space<br>
            after finishing these courses here at codefellows.</p>
